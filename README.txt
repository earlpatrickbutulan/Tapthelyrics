          TapTheLyrics is an android karaoke application game that syncs audio and text file. It is much more related and similar to a typical karaoke game that we can search and find on an android app store. We are using an open-source development tool called Eclipse, Android SDK and Wamp for managing of the songs which are manage using PHP. All the songs are saved in a specific directory which the Android must access if the user is going to play the game. The idea of the game came from a famous tv game show "The Singing Bee" where the host would provide the song. A portion of the song is performed by the band, and then the contestant must guess and attempt to sing the next line of the song. The user must have to guess all the missing lyrics in order to gain high score.

                                              How to Install the Application

          In order to open and access the game, you must have an Eclipse as your integrated development enrivonment (IDE) on your desktop/s or laptop/s. Then, go to www.github.com, search for "Tapthelyrics" and download the source code. After downloading the source code file on github. Extract the files on the desktop or on any folder you want to. Open your Eclipse (IDE) and import the folder "Tapthelyrics" on your IDE and there you go!
